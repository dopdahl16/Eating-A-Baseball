The world's first guide to bodily consuming a standard 5 - 5 1‚ÅÑ4 oz baseball!

After reading that post, I kept on wondering if it would be possible to eat a baseball. It would not leave my mind. I started to ask around the Luther ball team and not a single person said that it would not be possible, but there was much heated debate over how long it would take to do it and not "get seriously messed up". The team at large seemed to come to the conclusion that the most dangerous part would be the rubber in the center. It was mostly agreed upon that the leather on the outside, the cotton string, and the cork in the center would be relatively harmless (and in fact, one could put all three of those components down in under a week).
Having exhaused the conundrum with the baseball team, personally, I still was not satisfied. I then consulted some STEM majors in a very regulated and scientific poll on a Saturday night over a couple mojitos. We began to investigate the toxisity of the rubber and look more closely at how the wool yarn might bunch up in ones intestines and cause blockages, but after a couple hours of debate and research, the group decided to focus on other things for the night.
I was still unsatisfied. Obviously this calls for a deeper investigation into the plausibility of eating the constituent parts of a regular baseball. The primary question: is it possible, and if so, how long would it take an average person to eat a baseball safely so as to not get "messed up"?
